•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The code I was given was the GameExperience.py, TeasureMaze.py and the Poley_Cody_ProjectTwo.ipynb code. Using the pseudocode provided I changed the Poley_cody_ProjectTwo.ipynb to create a for loop that repeats for each number of epochs. In the loop the agent cell is given a random free cell from the available spots then the maze is reset with the agent moved to the new location and the state is set to the new current state. The values game over, and number of episodes are set to default. Next a while loop is created with the parameters of if game over is not true and the current state is set to previous state. If random is less, then epsilon action equals random valid action else action is set from predict previous state. Episode is set with previous state, action, reward, current state, and game status and is saved to experience. Number of episodes is increased by one and inputs and target is set, and model fit with inputs, target, epochs, and batch size. If game status equals win history gets append 1 and 0 if lost and if game status equals neither game over stays false. Once over number of losses is determine and win rate is found. 

•	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists do many things counting on the degree they have and certifications they hold. For example, before starting my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I was working on associate degree in Computer Science taking classes Cisco Networking One through four and from my experience in these classes’ computer scientists can build and design networks. However, with a bachelor’s degree computer scientist focus more on creating programs from web applications to apps on phones, and many more types of programs. One example is AI by creating AI in are programs we create programs that learn and improve themselves. While this may be slow now maybe in the future it will end problems for humanity. For example, what if the AI used to play Go was given a problem like seed development and it found away to increase the food supply worldwide. 

•	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist I approach problems by using the step through approach. I start by looking at how the program starts whether it be login or a greeting. I then create it using the guild lines given and then work on the next part of the program such as getting information from the user or giving the user information stepping through the program one step at a time tell the program is complete. 

•	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities when creating a program are to create a fair program with no bias. While I do not allows have the choice of tester, I do have the ability to let my boss know we need a diverse group for testing. When creating the program, I also need to look up laws to ensure I as a developer am not creating a program that is illegal or could cause harm to others.
